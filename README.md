Importance: Alzheimer Disease (AD) is characterized by development of amyloid and tau proteins over a relatively long prodromal phase. The National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA)  defines “Alzheimer’s pathologic change” as the appropriate diagnosis for an individual with biomarker evidence of amyloid but not tau. “Alzheimer’s disease” is a label that should only be applied if biomarker evidence of both amyloid and pathological tau exists. The NIA-AA Research Framework allows for classification via Amyloid Tau Neurodegeneration (AT(N)) using multiple biomarkers for each of the three categories.

Objectives: The purpose of this analysis is to identify the time window for which CSF and imaging markers of AT(N) have the greatest concordance. 

Design, Setting, and Participants: 692 participants enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) were included. Imaging biomarkers, including positron emission tomography (PET) for amyloid (A) and tau (T) and structural MRI (N) were obtained. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was also obtained for these participants, and CSF Aβ42, pTau181, and Neurofilament Light (NfL) were assayed.

Results: CSF Aβ42 and PET PiB have high concordance when collected within 6 years of each other (R > 0.8). The greatest concordance between CSF pTau181 and PET Tau is observed when the lumbar puncture is performed 4 to 8 years prior to the PET image acquisition (R > 0.5). CSF NfL and AD cortical thickness have relatively low concordance, regardless of temporal window (Ravg = -0.185). 

Conclusions and Relevance: Researchers and clinicians evaluating amyloid can expand beyond what is commonly used, allowing for samples for which CSF was acquired as many as 6 years prior to, or 2 years after, PET collection. Care should be taken, however, when classifying individuals as “Tau Positive” in the AT(N) framework. Tau levels observed in the CSF precede tau accumulation measured by PET by 4 – 8 years.
